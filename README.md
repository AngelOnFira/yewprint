blueprint-rs
============

It's [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com), but for
[Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This is in early development and it is possible it won't be finished if there
is no interest. Don't use this in production! Please help or at least leave it
a star to let me know you are interested in this project.
